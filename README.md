# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

//I'm Skyler Wormac, I just use he and him. I'm mainly a platformer junkie, though I delve into some other genre's of games. I mostly enjoy Nintendo games, from a majority of their franchises, alongside SEGA's offerings. Favorite franchises are Sonic the Hedgehog and Kirby. I'm taking this class just because I had a decently sized interest in video games, even though I haven't gotten the chance to play much lately. I used to take a coding class, but it was brief and I hardly remember anything, and beyond that the only experience in game design I've had was a brief (joke) visual novel I made for a friend. Right now, I just hope to make some quaint, simple, but enjoyable games that aren't too time consuming on both the player and creative sides, similar to something you'd see in a Game Jam.  

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

//As stated previously, I just want the chance to be able to make smaller, simpler games for myself, friends, and family revolving around random ideas I might have off the top of my head. My main passion when it comes to video games is design and storytelling, but I do feel that it's important to learn the fundamentals of programming as well, since it's equally, if not more, important.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

//I'm not really nervous about a lot of things when it comes to this class, besides maybe any group work that might have to be done later on. I've always been more oriented around working alone or with people that I know very well.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)

//I worked a little with Java very briefly, but I don't remember much about it at all.

2. Game development (any engine)

//I have very fragmented bits of knowledge about Game Maker Studio and Renpy, but once again that knowledge hardly goes anywhere.

3. Unity

//I have no knowledge about how Unity functions.

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document

//I am not aware of what this means (N/A)

2. Scope management

//I believe scope management means ensuring that your vision of a game doesn't become bloated over time, constantly adding new concepts that stack up, making a simple game much more difficult to complete as it gets bigger and bigger. Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach suffered from this, if I remember correctly, resulting in the poor state the game ended up releasing in.

3. Iteration

//I believe iterations refer to the different states a game goes through as it's developed, where some sections or entire chunks are incomplete, such as alpha and beta builds. I've always been pretty interested in seeing earlier versions of games that I'm very familiar with, as they typically have many differences from the final product. "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" was supposed to have almost double its finalized level count, and remnants of those ideas can be seen in earlier builds of the game. "Kirby's Return to Dreamland" also started as a project called Kirby GCN on the Gamecube.

4. Object-Oriented programming

//I do not know what this means (N/A)

5. Model-View-Controller architecture

//I do not know what this means either (N/A)
